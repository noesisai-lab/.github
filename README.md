# Noesis AI

**Towards Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence**

---

## Vision

At **Noesis AI**, we believe that intelligence is not a static goal — it is a dynamic, evolving process. Our mission is to explore, design, and open-source the foundations of the next era of Artificial Intelligence: one that learns not just like machines, but like minds.

We are a non-profit research organization based in Milan, Italy, committed to advancing the field of AI through a bold and multidisciplinary approach. Our focus is on building systems that move beyond the limitations of current paradigms and towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

## Our Mission

We are actively working on:

- **Brain-Inspired Architectures**  
  Designing novel neural architectures inspired by biological cognition, with the goal of enabling more general, adaptive, and energy-efficient intelligence.

- **Next-Generation Training Paradigms**  
  Exploring learning methods that go beyond backpropagation — including unsupervised, self-supervised, neuro-symbolic, and continual learning.

- **Tensor Computation and AI Hardware**  
  Developing new techniques to make tensor operations faster, more scalable, and hardware-aware. Our aim is to align software design with future generations of AI-optimized processors.

- **AI in Healthcare**  
  Applying our models to medical domains to improve diagnostics, precision medicine, and patient outcomes — responsibly and ethically.

- **Open Collaboration and Open Science**  
  All our research and code are and will remain open-source. You can follow our progress and contribute on our GitHub:

## Why Now?

We are living through an era of **exponential progress**. Traditional thinking, shaped by linear change, is no longer sufficient. The future arrives faster than we can predict — and the only way to navigate it is to build it consciously.

> *"We do not merely adapt to the future — we design it."*

To truly unlock AGI, we need more than bigger models and more data. We need new metaphors, new mathematics, and new kinds of collaboration. We must move from mimicking intelligence to **understanding** it.

## Who We Are

Noesis AI is a young and fast-growing community of researchers, engineers, and thinkers founded by Mattia Beltrami in 2025 and based in Milan. We are currently in our early stages, laying the groundwork for a long-term vision. But our ambition is clear: to contribute transformative ideas and tools to the global AI ecosystem.

Whether you're a student, a professional, or an independent thinker, we invite you to join us. We welcome contributors from all disciplines — neuroscience, computer science, philosophy, physics, and beyond.

## Get Involved

We're just getting started, and the road ahead is long. But **we're building it in the open** — and we want you with us.
